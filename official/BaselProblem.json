    "default": "The Basel problem is a legendary puzzle in mathematics, first proposed in the 17th century and famously solved by Leonhard Euler. It asks a deceptively simple question: what is the sum of the inverse squares of all positive integers? This infinite series, 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ..., converges to a finite value, but what? \n\nIn the Basel Problem theory, stand in Euler's shoes as you navigate the world of inverse squares. Everything in this theory revolves around them - variables based on partial sums, variable power scaling, and even the publication multiplier. Can you figure out the solution to this ancient problem?"
